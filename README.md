# BalouBot

## Install and run

First you need to create a telegram bot: <https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot>

Once you have your bot authorization token, create a `.env` file:

```
# .env

export BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_BOT_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN"
```

You should be able to speak with your bot then!
